\section{Ethical concerns of AI-based content algorithms}

\subsection{Opacity of AI Systems}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Black box algorithms}

  	\begin{itemize}

		\item The learning done by machine learning models is opaque - engineers don't know the internal logic of their model, just the constraints they are trying to optimize
		\item Social media companies generally keep their algorithms under wrap
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Youtube employed a neural network to make content recommendations in 2016
				\item meta?
			\end{itemize}
		\item Successful social media algorithms are designed to maximize user engagement and advertising revenue

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Youtube used a --- learning model where videos were given a positive score based on how long a video was watched, and a negative score if the video was not watched
				\item Features included the users age, gender, and search history
				\item Objective was to autoplay videos that would keep the user engaged for as long as possible
